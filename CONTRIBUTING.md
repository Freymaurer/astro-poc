# URLS

This project uses a link collection in `src/statics.ts` to manage all URLS. These MUST be imported in .astro components and can be used in markdown files via `[Back home]({{internal_home}})`. Pay attention to the double curly braces (`{{}}`) around the keyword from `src/statics.ts`. This should **not** be case sensitive. Should you add a typo or the link in the url collection gets updated the plugin `src/plugins/remark-replace-links.ts` will create a warning in the console.

Alternatively, you can make an `.mdx` file instead of `.md`. You can simply change the file extension to do this.

In an `.mdx` file you can import the typescript URLS directly and use it inside an html tag like this

```mdx
import { URLS } from 'PATH/TO/statics.ts'

<a href={URLS.INTERNAL_HOME}>Back home</a>
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

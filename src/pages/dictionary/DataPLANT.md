DataPLANTâ€™s mission is to provide a sustainable and well annotated data management platform for plant sciences.
It will pave the way from classical paper publication to pure data publication as ARCs.

DataPLANT is part of the [NFDI](https://www.nfdi.de/) initiative for **data as a common good for excellent research**.
It is also known as _nfdi4plants_

A uniform, polyglot (.NET, Python, Javascript), low-level library for creating and managing ARCs.
The ARCtrl library supports a wide set of base operations for working with different [ARC representations]({{INTERNAL_DEV_REPRESENTATION}}), which it can parse and write.
It supports all sorts of CRUD operations on the top-level layer, including manipulation of investigations, studies, assays, persons and many more.
You can read more about the ARCtrl developer toolkit [here]({{INTERNAL_DEV_TOOLSTACK}}).
